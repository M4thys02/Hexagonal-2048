# Hexagonal 2048

**Hexagonal 2048** is a single-player puzzle game inspired by the classic 2048, adapted to a hexagonal grid. The game allows you to choose a starting prime number and merge tiles to reach higher powers of that prime.

## Features

* **Hexagonal Grid:** Each move shifts tiles in one of six directions.  
* **Post-Game Score Screen:** After finishing the game, see your highest achieved number.  
* **Easter Egg:** If you reach the maximum achievable number, a random joke appears (powered by the `pyjokes` library).
